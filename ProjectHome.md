Windows Event Log for Java (wel4j) allows Java applications to log events to the Microsoft Windows event log via the [Java Native Interface (JNI)](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/).

As well as direct access to the event log, the library provides an Appender for applications which perform application logging via [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/) and a Handler for applications which log via [java.util.logging (JUL)](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/logging/index.html), allowing use of the Windows event log as an output for these frameworks.
